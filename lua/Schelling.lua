--- Schelling's segregation model. In 1971, the American economist Thomas Schelling created 
-- an agent-based model that might help explain why segregation is so difficult to combat.
-- His model of segregation showed that even when individuals (or "agents") didn't mind being
-- surrounded or living by agents of a different race, they would still choose to segregate
-- themselves from other agents over time! Although the model is quite simple, it gives a
-- fascinating look at how individuals might self-segregate, even when they have no explicit
-- desire to do so. A small preference for one's neighbors to be of the same color could lead
-- to total segregation. In Schellinga model, initially black and white families are randomly
-- distributed. At each step in the modeling process the families examine their immediate
-- neighborhood and either stay put or move elsewhere depending on whether the local racial
-- composition suits their preferences. The procedure is repeated until everyone finds a
-- satisfactory home (or until the simulatorâ€™s patience is exhausted).
-- @arg data.dim The x and y dimensions of space. The default value is 25.
-- @arg data.freeSpace The percentage of space that is not filled with any agent
-- along the simulation. The default value is 25.
-- @arg data.preference What is the minimum number of neighbor agents be like me
-- that makes me satisfied with my current cell? The default value is 3.
-- @arg data.finalTime The final simulation time. The default value is 500.
